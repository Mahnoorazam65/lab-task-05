**Name:** Mahnoor Azam
**Roll No:** CS- 4th Semester
**Section:** A

This lab demonstrates all 18 tasks from WT Lab 5 handout. I have implemented all tasks in a single 'index.html' file and styled using 'style.css' . The layout techniques include display, float positioning, flexbox, grid, and media queries.
Each task section is clearly labeled with comments in the code.
